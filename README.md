Hello! I am a recent graduate of a Software Engineering bootcamp, AppAcademy, where I learned full stack technologies including JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Flask, Express, React, and Redux. I love solving problems and creating new things when coding. Before attending AppAcademy, I completed an associates degree program at a university in my area. I was not sure what I wanted to do career-wise, so I took a break from work and school for a couple of years when I got married. I did a lot of research about different kinds of careers, and ultimately chose software engineering because it is very interesting, and something I could enjoy doing. I learned more than I thought I would since starting this journey, and I've enjoyed learning how to use all of the different languages and technologies, and solving problems. My favorite part about developing is being given a task, writing the code to make it work, then testing it out for the first time and seeing it do what it's supposed to. I am excited for what the future holds working as a software developer. My hobbies include exploring the world with my husband, beauty/aesthetics/skin care, cooking/baking, shopping, and organizing!
