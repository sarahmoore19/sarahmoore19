Hello! I am a recent graduate of an immersive Software Engineering course, AppAcademy. AppAcademy is a 1500+ hour bootcamp, where I learned full stack technologies including JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Flask, Express, React, and Redux. Before attending AppAcademy, I completed an associates degree program at a university in my area. I was not sure what I wanted to do career-wise, so I took a break from work and school for a couple of years when I got married. When I started thinking about a career again, I still had no idea what I wanted to do for a few months. I did a lot of research about different kinds of careers. Finally, I landed on something in the tech space because of the promising future of the industry, job stability, remote work availability, and finally, I found it very interesting, something I could enjoy doing. I learned more than I thought I could at AppAcademy, and it opened up my eyes to what I was capable of. I've enjoyed learning how to use all of the different languages and technologies, and solving problems. My favorite part about developing is being given a task, writing the code to make it work, and then testing it out for the first time and seeing it do what you want it to do. I am excited for what the future holds, and to work as a software developer. My hobbies include exploring the world with my husband, cooking, baking, shopping, and organizing!
